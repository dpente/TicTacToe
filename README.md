## Tic Tac Toe

### Goal
Play tic tac toe against Ai using the minimax algorithim.

### Run the game
Open the project in unity and run the scene with the play button.

### Features
- Intuitive UI.

### Dead code
So i could not get the mini max algorithm to work properly in my game. I feel like i got close but the ai plays its moves in order of buttons rather than in the ideal position. I Used two tutorials that i think where incompatible and tried to reverse enginer Java script into c# which wasnt the best. I believe i have a fairly solid understanding of the algorithim but have failed to implement it in practice.
